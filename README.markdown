Flipstone VIM Files
===================

Installation
------------

Run the command below in your terminal. It will prompt for confirmation before destroying
your current vim configuration. This will also try to compile the Command T plugin. You'll 
need to have the same ruby available in your shell that was used when VIM was compiled.
(e.g. `rvm use system`)

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/flipstone/vim_dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
