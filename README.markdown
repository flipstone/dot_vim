Flipstone VIM Files
===================

Installation
------------

Run the command below in your terminal. It will prompt for confirmation before destroying
your current vim configuration. This will also try to compile the Command T plugin. You'll 
need to have the same ruby available in your shell that was used when VIM was compiled.
(e.g. `rvm use system`)

    curl https://raw.github.com/flipstone/dot_vim/master/install.sh -o /tmp/fs_vim_install.sh && bash /tmp/fs_vim_install.sh
